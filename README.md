**Business Problem:**  
Hospitals struggle to accurately identify patients who are at high risk of developing heart disease during routine checkups. Traditional screening methods often fail to capture complex interactions between clinical features—such as blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG abnormalities, chest pain type, and exercise-induced symptoms—leading to misclassification of high-risk and low-risk patients. This results in delayed diagnoses, unnecessary testing, and inefficient use of medical resources. The organization wants to build a data-driven risk-prediction system that can classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on their demographic, physiological, and clinical measurements.

**Your Role:**  
You have been brought on as a **Healthcare Data Scientist** to design an end-to-end predictive solution that estimates heart-disease risk from patient attributes. You will explore the dataset, engineer features, build ML or DL models, evaluate their performance, and ultimately deliver a deployed application that supports clinicians in making earlier and more accurate decisions during routine cardiac assessments.

## 🟢 Beginner Track

The Beginner Track focuses on building a traditional **machine learning–based heart-disease risk classifier**. You'll explore the dataset, engineer features, train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and deploy your best-performing model in a simple Streamlit app. This track is ideal if you're strengthening your ML foundations and learning to build end-to-end predictive pipelines.

📌 Get started:  
➡️ [Beginner Track Scope of Works](./beginner/README.md)  
➡️ [Beginner Report Template](./beginner/REPORT.md)  
➡️ [Submit your work](./beginner/submissions/)

## 🔴 Advanced Track

The Advanced Track takes the project further by leveraging **deep learning architectures** to model complex clinical patterns in the data. You'll design and train feedforward neural networks, experiment with embeddings for categorical features, apply regularization techniques, integrate explainability methods like SHAP, and deploy your deep learning model in a production-style application. This track is designed for participants ready to deepen their skills with modern DL techniques for tabular health data.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the well-known Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which includes 14 important clinical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and more.

Participants will use these variables to develop predictive models that classify the likelihood of heart disease.
